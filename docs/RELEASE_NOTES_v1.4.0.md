# Release v1.4.0: Full Modularization

## Highlights

- All major features are now implemented as modular React components in `src/components/`.
- App.jsx refactored to use only imported components for UI sections.
- Improved maintainability, scalability, and code clarity.
- No breaking changes for users; all previous features preserved.

## Features

- Modularized architecture: Settings, Templates, Main Form, Meeting History/Reporting, Export/Share, and Slack Integration are now separate components.
- Easier future development: New features will be added as components.
- Updated README and package.json to reflect modularization and v1.4.0.

## How to Upgrade

- Pull the latest code and use as before. All extension features remain available, now with a cleaner codebase.
